Device Testing
===

> It's always a good idea to test things on physical devices, here is an easy way to test our site in yours.

![Web Design](img/web-design.png "Web Design")

With the website up and running on your local developer machine, you can easily preview it on any external device on
the **Same Local WiFi Network** using Your Local IP Address.

Let's say your local IP address is **`192.168.1.100`**, you would just need to point your external device to **`http://192.168.1.100:8081/`**

### Super Easy :)

Not sure how to find your local IP address? I made a little tool to help _( if you are using Google Chrome or FireFox on a Desktop )_.
